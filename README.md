# DiscordPokedex


This is a WIP Discord bot that requires discord.js

This Pokedex is designed with statistics for the Pokemon Go mobile app.
This bot is designed to accept input from users within Discord and reply with important information on Pokemon type as well as specific Pokemon.

A better write up/wiki will be coming soon but please feel free to create a PR if you want to make any updates/additions.

Contact me on Discord if you have any questions, Gladiator10864#0384
